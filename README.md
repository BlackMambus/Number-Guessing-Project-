🔢 Number Guessing Game: A Simple Test of Intuition and Strategy

The Number Guessing Game is a classic exercise in deduction, perfect for honing logical thinking and having quick fun. You try to guess a number selected by the computer (or your friend) within a given range—usually with a limited number of attempts.

Here’s how it usually works:

🎲 Random Target: The game randomly selects a number, say between 1 and 100.

💬 Player Guesses: You input a number, and the game tells you if it’s too high, too low, or correct.

🎯 Attempts Counter: Most versions track how many guesses you've made—or limit the number you get.

📈 Difficulty Levels: Some versions adjust the range or give fewer hints as difficulty increases.

🏁 End Conditions: The game ends when you guess the number.
